#Dear all
We have finished our code but we can not upload it to the previous repository since lacking of access right.


# frequency_table_video_words
Frequency Table for video words

# Goal
word         | frequency     | level
------------ | ------------- | -------------
apple | 1000 | 1
banana | 300 | Not in Dictionary
.|.|.
.|.|.
.|.|.

# How to run
*Please put the steps to run the program or if is a just a code we can run in jupyter*

Total words in video = 52646
No repeat words = 12008

It is just a code we can run in jupyter*

There are 8039 words that is not in Dictionary.
But there are many strange words (aka noisy) such as (for example):

"/icons/text"\n
"30"'\n
">michelleobamaspeech_eng"

in postId = "4561"

However, the frequency of these words are almost 1.
Maybe we can ignore them since the low frequency or do propocessing with these words.

If there is any error, please inform us.
Thank you very much.
